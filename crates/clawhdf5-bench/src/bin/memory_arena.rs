//! MemoryArena-style Multi-Session Benchmark (Track 8.2)
//!
//! Generates deterministic synthetic multi-session conversations and evaluates
//! the retrieval system's ability to answer single-session and cross-session queries.
//!
//! # Design
//! - 50 sessions × 20 turns = 1000 total turns per "user"
//! - Topics: personal info, preferences, past events, schedule items, hobbies
//! - 100 queries: single-session, cross-session, temporal ordering, contradiction
//! - All embeddings are zero vectors; evaluation is BM25-only
//!
//! # Reproducibility
//! All data is deterministic — no random number generator is used.
//!
//! # Usage
//! ```
//! cargo run --release --bin memory_arena
//! ```
